# SpeedReader

> Stop reading the old-fashioned way

## The Goal

I use this desktop app on a daily basis to improve my reading comprension and speed. 

Regular text stays in place and your eyes have to scan over the lines. But this app flashes a single word at a time on the screen. This means your eyes have to move less. And you never have to lose time searching for the beginning of the next line.

The app also allows you to set the number of words/minute you want to read. Which is ideal if you want to build up to reading faster.

## The Program
No frills. I wrote this little app because I needed it.

Just copy your text into the window, hit LOAD, then PLAY.

You can pause at any time, or even change the play speed during runtime.

To run, install the Scala RTE, and compile on the commandline:

    scalac SpeedReader.scala

and then run:

    scala SpeedReader
